I've been off of opiates since June 22, 2018 and benzos since January 2017. While getting off of benzos I had multiple seizures and really thought I was going to die. When getting off of opiates I felt like I was going to die but knew I just had to ride it out. Thank you God for helping me through it all!",

        "text": "I have a friend whose downward spiral began with benzos. He was prescribed them for his PTSD after 2 tours in Afghanistan. He then began drinking heavily and went to opiate pills then heroin. Now he's on meth. He's a shadow of his former self. He's a skeleton. He OD'd a couple months ago but survived. The military has paid for his rehab several times before, but what I never understood is they will wean him off everything but the benzos. He stays clean a few months except for the Xanax then he starts the same cycle all over again. It's heartbreaking to watch someone you love destroy themselves, and there's nothing you can do to stop it.",

I have to laugh at people who think Peterson becoming dependent on benzos somehow discredits him but imo it actually fortifies his teachings. He was self aware enough to realize he had a problem and then wad strong enough to remedy the problem. I'm not a disciple of his and there are plenty of things I disagree with but I respect the man and enjoy listening to his logic.",

If you quit cold turkey you may go into shock and cardiac arrest.  One of the saddest client experiences was when a mother and her 8 year old came to us.  His school counsellor mentioned that he was having problems with his attention and he seemed anxious in class.  The boy was prescribed 3 different medications and two, TWO were benzos.  Turns out that he wasn't sleeping well because he was being bullied by some older boys and he was fearful of recess and lunch because that's where they would corner him and that's all he could think about.  This child had to go through the withdrawals that an adult should never have to experience, because some school counsellor thought that he needed drugs instead of looking for the root cause of the anxiety in the first place.  What a world.",

Yes it took a long time, yes I’ve heard I’m just an addict from people who don’t understand. I think because I went so slow, I really didn’t have a hard time when I made the final jump, made the time worth it. When I found out JP had been on klonopin my heart sank. It’s a very strong benzo and can make people really sick while on them, let alone the terror of getting off. I am so happy this man made it through. It’s an extremely difficult feat and many people off themselves because of protracted w/ds.",
