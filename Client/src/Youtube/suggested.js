                "description": "Behati Prinsloo and Adam Levine are mixing business with pleasure! The 33-year-old model opens up to ET’s Deidre Behar about working with her husband on the tequila label they co-founded, Calirosa, available now. Behati explains why they decided to work together on this passion project, and what it’s like collaborating on business decisions. Meanwhile, the two are busy raising their daughters, 5-year-old Dusty Rose and 3-year-old Gio Grace. The former Victoria’s Secret Angel opens up about their little ones’ vastly different personalities and explains how they’re starting to understand their parents’ fame. Behati also praises Adam for being an incredible girl dad. She even jokes that he’s said he wouldn’t know what to do with a baby boy. Behati and Adam love having dance parties with their kids at home, adding that the little ones specifically request music by their dad’s band, Maroon 5, and love the ‘Songs About Jane’ album. As for whether the couple will continue expanding their family, Behati reveals they’re leaving it up to chance -- however, she admits she’d like to have five children! With busy careers and their roles as parents, the Namibian native explains how she and Adam continue prioritizing their nearly 8-year marriage.",
